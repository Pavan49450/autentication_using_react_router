India retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to a republic, when the Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India. India attained independence following the independence movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience.","date":"2023-08-15","id":"698a5798-28be-4b0b-a96b-965a173dd9f7"},{"title":"Holy","image":"https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.RK1fei2pmAJUnbRGUazTJwHaE6?w=260&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7","description":"Holy is a festival colors and absolute joy.","date":"2023-03-29","id":"bbf298c6-b070-4344-bf27-5cd43581b3bf"},{"title":"Diwali","image":"https://i0.wp.com/youmeandtrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Happy-Diwali-images-with-crackers.jpg?fit=2448,1555&ssl=1","description":"It is festival of lights and pure joy.","date":"2023-09-20","id":"a0b20cce-c1b1-4818-ab7b-f83d7379b40c"}],"users":[{"email":"pavan@gmail.com","password":"$2a$12$GqBpYBbmaPhknDQlzz9hMOYxJV12uK5OnANVLY7v2POSDEltyJri6","id":"5f60e3d7-a037-4ad7-abfb-b0df1a52c6f3"},{"email":"nobody@gmail.com","password":"$2a$12$y.UgthbwtPklaeVWXAyrQ.xxxILm7F45cd57Q7zgve22CyD6OVg8m","id":"d2339612-36b4-47c4-9c3d-09509a7b51c0"},{"email":"kattulapavan.kumar@tcs.com","password":"$2a$12$c.WWDH85NJk2wewBRCmbnOhsexYeSqtUI7oHk9tXHsL3i.6XTeChq","id":"d57d8b95-860f-4ca6-9e66-bf6b7c81861c"}]}
